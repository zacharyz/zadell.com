In the court of software engineering, there is a constant, deafening noise: the sound of the *new*. New frameworks, new paradigms, new ways to center a `div`. It is easy to mistake this noise for progress.

But as a Principal Engineer, my currency is not novelty; it is **stability**.

### The Lindy Effect

The **Lindy Effect** is a concept from Nassim Taleb which suggests that the future life expectancy of a non-perishable thing (like a technology or an idea) is proportional to its current age.

*   If a book has been in print for 40 years, it can be expected to be in print for another 40.
*   If a database has survived for 20 years, it will likely survive 20 more.

This is why I often choose **PostgreSQL** over the flavor-of-the-month vector store. It is why I respect **Rails** and **Django** even in a world of serverless edge functions. These tools have been forged in the fires of production for decades. They have seen every edge case. They have broken in every conceivable way, and they have been fixed.

### Innovation Tokens

This doesn't mean we become luddites. It means we spend our **"Innovation Tokens"** wisely.

Dan McKinley famously proposed that every company gets about three innovation tokens. You can spend them on:
1.  A novel database.
2.  A new microservices architecture.
3.  A cutting-edge frontend framework.

But you cannot spend them on *everything*. If you try to run a startup on a new language, a new database, AND a new deployment platform, you will fail. Not because the tech is bad, but because you are fighting the entropy of the unknown on too many fronts.

### The Sovereign Choice

When I architect a system for a client, I am looking for **Sovereignty**. I want them to own their destiny, not to be beholden to a VC-backed SaaS that might pivot or die next Tuesday.

Boring technology is sovereign technology. It is documented. It is hireable. It is predictable.

So yes, I will build you a bleeding-edge AI agent. But I will likely store its memory in Postgres. Because long after the hype cycle has moved on, your data must remain.
