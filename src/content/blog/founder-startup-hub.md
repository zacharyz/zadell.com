# Microsoft's Founder Hub: Bootstrapping My LLM Startup

Let's be honest - building an AI startup isn't cheap. When you're dealing with Large Language Models, the computing costs alone can make your eyes water. That's exactly the challenge I faced when starting to build my LLM-based API platform, and why Microsoft's Founder Hub caught my attention.

## Why I Chose Microsoft's Startup Hub

The math was simple: developing and hosting LLMs requires serious computational power, and Azure credits could be a game-changer. While other cloud providers offer startup credits too, Microsoft's program stood out because:

- They offer substantial Azure credits specifically for AI/ML workloads
- Their infrastructure is battle-tested for LLM deployment
- The technical mentorship focuses on AI scaling challenges

### The Application Process

My pitch was straightforward:

- I'm building an API platform to make LLM deployment more accessible
- Current cloud costs are a major barrier for AI startups
- Azure's infrastructure aligns perfectly with our scaling needs

## Navigating the Evaluation

The selection process was rigorous. Microsoft's team was looking for:

- Clear technological innovation
- Strong market potential
- Alignment with their cloud ecosystem

## The Outcome

I'm thrilled to share that our startup was accepted into the Founder Startup Hub! This means:

- Substantial Azure cloud credits
- Technical mentorship
- Access to Microsoft's startup network

### What's Next

With these resources, we're now positioned to:

- Scale our LLM API infrastructure
- Optimize our Azure-based deployment
- Accelerate our product development
